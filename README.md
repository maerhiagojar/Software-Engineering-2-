# Flood Simulation Model in Bulan, Sorsogon

## üìå Project Description
This project focuses on developing a **Flood Simulation Model** in **Bulan, Sorsogon** to enhance flood preparedness, monitoring, and response. The system integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** for flood prediction and **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** for simulating flood scenarios, resource allocation, and evacuation planning.  

By combining real-time data collection, predictive analytics, and simulation tools, the project aims to improve decision-making, optimize rescue operations, and ensure efficient resource distribution during flood events.

# **Agile SDLC Model (Scrum) for Flood Simulation System**

### **1. Requirement Gathering & Planning (Product Backlog)**

* Collect requirements from stakeholders (LGU, residents, researchers).
* Create **user stories** (e.g., ‚ÄúAs a resident, I want to receive a flood warning when heavy rainfall is detected‚Äù).
* Build the **Product Backlog** (list of features: rainfall data integration, ABM simulation, ML prediction, SMS alerts, evacuation center mapping).

---

### **2. Sprint Planning**

* Select high-priority items from the Product Backlog to work on in the current sprint.
* Define sprint goal and expected deliverables (e.g., Sprint 1: rainfall data collection & prototype).

---

### **3. Development (Sprints)**

* Work in **time-boxed sprints** (1‚Äì2 weeks each).
* Example sprints for your system:

  * **Sprint 1:** Map interface + rainfall data input
  * **Sprint 2:** Barangay database + visualization
  * **Sprint 3:** Agent-Based Simulation prototype
  * **Sprint 4:** Machine Learning rainfall prediction
  * **Sprint 5:** Early warning alert (SMS/Notif)
  * **Sprint 6:** Admin dashboard + evacuation center suggestion
  * **Sprint 7:** Refinement & integration testing

---

### **4. Daily Stand-ups**

* Short daily meetings to discuss:

  * What was done yesterday
  * What will be done today
  * Any blockers (problems/issues)

---

### **5. Testing (Continuous within Sprints)**

* Unit testing for rainfall input, ABM, ML models.
* Integration testing of simulation + alert system.
* User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with selected community/LGU partners.

---

### **6. Sprint Review**

* End of each sprint:

  * Present working system increment to stakeholders.
  * Collect feedback (e.g., rainfall prediction accuracy, usability of alerts).

---

### **7. Sprint Retrospective**

* Team reflects on what went well and what can be improved for the next sprint.

---

### **8. Deployment & Maintenance**

* Incremental deployment in selected barangays.
* Continuous updates based on **new rainfall data**.
* Improve ML model accuracy over time.
* Add new features (ex. 3D flood visualization).
