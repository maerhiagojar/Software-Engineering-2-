# Flood Simulation Model in Bulan, Sorsogon

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project focuses on developing a **Flood Simulation Model** in **Bulan, Sorsogon** to enhance flood preparedness, monitoring, and response. The system integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** for flood prediction and **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** for simulating flood scenarios, resource allocation, and evacuation planning.  

By combining real-time data collection, predictive analytics, and simulation tools, the project aims to improve decision-making, optimize rescue operations, and ensure efficient resource distribution during flood events.
